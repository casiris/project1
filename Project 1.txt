						Project 1

Make sure you will work with all the rest standards (return httpstatus code, exceptioon, logging etc)
Web API / Rest API Project
	We need to create the REST API Service 

	
An App, which will help customer to feel the virtual energy
(Online shopping, Restaurant APP, Cab Booking app)

Functionalities

API shoule be able to perform the following operations
----------------------------------------------------------------------
	should be able to add new customer
	search the customer
	view list of customers
	Place an order for customer (eg. book a cab for customer when they call customer care)
	order history by customer
	display the details for the open orders / bookings
	view the history of all the transactions for any customer
	view the bill payable

	All the search to be based on the customerID or OrderId

--------------
Additional Mandatory Features
Exception Handling (throw appropriate error message)
Validations			-- only need try/catches to send a 400 error, not necessarily looping until the user enters a valid input 
No hard coded data anywhere in the code
all the data to be persisted to database
Database should be normalized upto 3NF
you need to have an ER diagram for the same for the data

----
Self Research, learn and implement
Logging - Serilog (this is very easy to implemennt) - log everything to db

ASP.NET WebAPI (model and controller, no view). model talks to the database, does whatever with the data, controller listens to requests
-swagger page is enough
